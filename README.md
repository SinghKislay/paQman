# paQman
Deep Q bot for packman. It is built with tensorflow 2.0 and has a replay buffer.
Work in progress.

Neural Net Architecture:
3 conv layers
3 fully connected layers

Future Plans:
1) Add priority replay buffer
2) Add Dueling DQN
3) Optimize for better performace.
4) Clean the code and make more readable and modular.(I swear)
